# Hangman - Typescript
This was one of my first projects. It was part of the online course I was attending by Andrew Mead. 

I've ported the app to typescript around 3 years after it's last commit. All of the vulnerabilities are now fixed, and I even bumped up the webpack version (v5). You can find the original under the `master` branch.

**To run it:**
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run build`
3. `npm run dev-server`

**Enjoy!**
