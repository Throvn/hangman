# Hangman

This was one of my first projects. It was part of the online course I was attending by Andrew Mead.
It has a lot of security vulnerabilities and should be ported to webpack 5, but I will leave it as is, as a tribute to the past.
If you still want to check it out, I ported the thing to typescript in the `typescript` branch. That branch is also up to date!

**To run it:** `npm install` & `npm run dev-server`

**Enjoy!**
